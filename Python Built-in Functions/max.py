"""The built-in max() method returns the item with the highest value, or the item with the highest
value in an iterable. If the values are strings, an alphabet comparison is done. The syntax is
max(n1, n2, n3, ...)."""

x = max(5, 10)
print(x)  # It compares 5 and 10, and returns 10 because it is the biggest
