"""The built-in min() method returns the item with the lowest value, or the item with the
lowest value in an iterable. If the values are strings, an alphabetically comparison is done.
The syntax is min(n1, n2, n3, ...)."""

x = min(5, 10)
print(x)  # It compares 5 and 10, returns 5 because it is smaller
